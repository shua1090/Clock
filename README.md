# Clock

A collection of GUI Clocks written in Python (TKinter), Java (JavaFX), and C++ (SFML)

## Running
- C++: Use the makefile to build the program into an executable (assuming SFML is properly installed and set in the makefile)
- Java: Run a simple mvn package, and you should be good to go
- Python: Run the Python file using the python command (or however you like)

The Python file is outdated and written when I didn't know how to program.

Special Thanks to Aditya Matam for helping with the makefile and some debugging of Trigonometry in the Java version.
